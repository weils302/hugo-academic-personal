When I have downloaded Procreate, I have found that it was hard to understand the way of using it. I have tried to draw something anyway, but it looks not so good. 
Finally, there is a [tutorial video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zE411C7Py?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=1920fa7f9c47f2879b82846fb2c6f3ba)
that made me decided to try an illustration by following it. This is the my final production.
